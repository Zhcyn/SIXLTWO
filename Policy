The game is a remake of the original Snake with pixel graphics and monophonic sounds. The goal is to make as many points as possible by making the snake eat stuff that shows up. The more you eat the longer will the snake grow. If the snake collides with itself the game ends. This version of the game was redone using latest swift libary and UIKit.
The current project is still under development, if you encounter any problems during the test, please contact me
